# Astar-route-planner-in-Cpp
Developed a route planner that plots the shortest path found using the A* search algorithm between two points on a real map using map data from the OpenStreetMap project. The program is written in C++ and uses the 2D rendering library IO2D to render the map data. The project covers pointers, references, OOP and it is compiled using CMake.
